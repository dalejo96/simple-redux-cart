# simple-redux-cart

Here is a basic React cart that is using redux toolkit and Firebase as a BE.

Here you can find the two ways of handling side-effects and async code with redux:

- Inside the components with `useEffect`
- Inside the action creators

Don't forget to change the URL of the real time database from Firebase.

Enjoy!
